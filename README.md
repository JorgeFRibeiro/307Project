### Project Description
The problem of not having a social networking application that pulls elements from other more popular social platforms affects people who want a succinct platform to connect. The impact of which is increased confusion and time spent understanding how each separate social media platform works. A successful solution would allow a person to be able to have an account in which they can edit or delete, as well as give the person the ability to interact with posts, post something of their own, and follow people or topics in which they find themselves interested in. We plan to implement this solution through our web app, Purdue Circle!
